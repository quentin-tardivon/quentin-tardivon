### Hey! I'm Quentin!

I'm a Software Engineer at [Rayon](https://rayon.design/). 
I do mainly Front-End with TypeScript and WebComponents!
I'm also very interested by Rust 🦀, WASM and WebGL.

You can find me:
- 🦣 lurking on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/web/@tardiou) 
- 🖼️ occasionally posting on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/quentintardivon/)

When I am offline, I play guitar, geek about modular synth and play video games.
